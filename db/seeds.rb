# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# (1..10).each do 
#     User.create!(
#         email: Faker::Internet.email,
#         password: "password",
#         password_confirmation: "password",
#         username: Faker::Lorem.word
#     )
# end

# (1..10).each do 
#     Post.create!(
#         caption: Faker::Lorem.sentence,
#         user_id: rand(1..10)
#     )
# end

# (1..10).each do 
#     Comment.create!(
#         text: Faker::Lorem.sentence,
